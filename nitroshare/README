Choose one of the qt platforms plugins below:
(You should already have libqxcb-glx-integration, libqxcb-egl-integration,
wayland-xcomposite-egl, wayland-xcomposite-glx
found in /usr/lib{arch}/qt5/plugins/{xcbglintegrations or
wayland-graphics-integration-client}) but these libraries are missing libinput
if you run ldd on them.  So make sure you have libinput as mentioned above.
