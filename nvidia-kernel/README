###### IMPORTANT NSA STUFF HERE #########
This script will automatically download all sources for you!  It will also
automatically determine your $ARCH and download the appropriate source.
To use a different version number, just edit the VERSION variable.

If you are on a custom kernel, make sure to disable rivafb or this will
not build.

**** DEPENDENCIES ****
Custom Kernel

	This requires a custom kernel with riva disabled (even if riva is
	enabled as a module it will not build and will give you an error).
	You can easily rebuild the same kernel that comes with slackware,
	just disable riva in menuconfig.

	You might get away with just removing the modules manually, or trying
	to get the script to bypass or ignore riva, yet this is not suggested.

	*** While you are in there building a custom kernel, consider just
	disabling nouveau as well, since you most likely will not need or 
	want it. ***

###### SANTA IS WATCHING YOU ############

This is the kernel-module needed by the proprietary binary nvidia driver.
You also need the nvidia-driver package from SlackBuilds.org.

To build the package for a kernel different from the running one,
start the script setting the KERNEL variable as in
    KERNEL=3.2.34 ./nvidia-kernel.SlackBuild

A default config file is placed at /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-nvidia.conf
to make sure that X loads the nvidia module.  If you need to make changes, 
copy that file to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ and edit the copy.  You do not need 
this file at all if you have a proper and complete xorg.conf.

The xf86-video-nouveau-blacklist package from /extra is required.
