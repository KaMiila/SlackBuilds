QTWebEngine wants to force pulseaudio as a dependency, but this script will build it without pulseaudio.

#### IT'S A TRAP ####
 THIS PULLS FROM GIT

YOU MIGHT NEED:
Since we all use and love python 2.7, this wants us to be using python 2.6.  If you get this error:

gyp: Call to '../3rdparty/chromium/build/linux/python_arch.sh /usr/lib/libpython2.6.so.1.0' returned exit status 1. while trying to load src/core/core.gyp
Project ERROR: -- running gyp_qtwebengine failed --

then add this to your ~/.gyp/include.gypi
	which will be root, and this file probably does not exist so you will need to create it.

{
 'variables': {
  'python_ver': '2.7'
 }
}

This requires qt5 version 5.3 to build.  QTWebEngine is very much beta.  If you don't like bugs, do not use this!

☭NSA☭ beta is watching you!
