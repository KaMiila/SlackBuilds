QTWebEngine wants to force pulseaudio as a dependency, but this script will build it without pulseaudio.

re2c is an option dependency which can be found here: http://slackbuilds.org/

warning: A compatible version of re2c (>= 0.11.3) was not found; changes to src/*.in.cc will not affect your build.

This uses the same tarball that the qt5 slackbuild uses.  My advise is to first build the qt5 slackbuild, then compile QTWebEnine.  I cannot figure out a way to force the GYP_CONFIG+="disable_fatal_linker_warnings=1" in the qt5 build since it uses configure and not qmake.  Perhaps a simple sed-line is required to add this in the proper file/location?

YOU MIGHT NEED:
Since we all use and love python 2.7, this wants us to be using python 2.6.  If you get this error:

gyp: Call to '../3rdparty/chromium/build/linux/python_arch.sh /usr/lib/libpython2.6.so.1.0' returned exit status 1. while trying to load src/core/core.gyp
Project ERROR: -- running gyp_qtwebengine failed --

then add this to your ~/.gyp/include.gypi
	which will be root, and this file probably does not exist so you will need to create it.

{
 'variables': {
  'python_ver': '2.7'
 }
}

This requires qt5 version 5.5.0 to build.  QTWebEngine is very much beta.  If you don't like bugs, do not use this!

You might have to upgrade sqlite to 3.8.8.2
You might have to upgrade PCRE to 8.36
Do these upgrades before compiling qt5!

☭NSA☭ beta is watching you!
