Sparsehash is an extremely memory-efficient hash_map implementation. 2 bits/entry overhead!
The SparseHash library contains several hash-map implementations, including implementations
that optimize for space or speed.

These hashtable implementations are similar in API to SGI's hash_map class and the tr1
unordered_map class, but with different performance characteristics. It's easy to replace
hash_map or unordered_map by sparse_hash_map or dense_hash_map in C++ code.

They also contain code to serialize and unserialize from disk.
