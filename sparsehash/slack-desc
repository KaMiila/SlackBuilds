# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

sparsehash: sparsehash (an extremely memory-efficient hash_map implementation)
sparsehash:
sparsehash: Two bits/entry overhead!  The SparseHash library contains several
sparsehash: hash-map implementations, including implementations that optimize
sparsehash: for space or speed
sparsehash: 
sparsehash: Similar in API to SGI's hash_map class and the tr1 unordered_map
sparsehash: class, but with different prerformance characteristics.
