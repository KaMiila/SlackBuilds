Originally written by Bob Schlärmann, this panel plugin shows information
about your local weather in the panel, using forecast data provided by met.no.

USAGE:

The first time you open the configuration dialog, the weather plugin automatically
configures itself to fetch weather data from a place which should be near you - based
on your IP address. It will also try to determine the units used in your country,
but you can alter these on the units page.

You can change this location using the Change… button and searching for the city,
country, address, monument etc. you're interested in. Only latitude, longitude and
altitude will be used for the data requests, so you can change the location name to
something you like. There's a further tab for appearance setting, and one for
customizing data visible in the scrollbox.

On the panel icon, a middle click forces an update, left click brings up a forecast
and details page. Right-clicking opens the contextual menu.

There are a lot of tooltips describing the options and values available.

NOTE: Since the API is constanly changing just to annoy the crap out of us linux users
this will pull directly from git.  So when the plugin fails to pull data, just re-compile
when the devs push an update to the API.
