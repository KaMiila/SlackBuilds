This will build Transmission with QT5 only.

Transmission is a lightweight open source BitTorrent client, providing
useful functionality without feature bloat. It consists of a daemon, a
GTK+, Qt and CLI client.

This will will build the daemon, cli, and qt client only.  THIS WILL NOT BUILD THE GTK CLIENT.
This script will also auto-download and verify the source code.
This will also install the transmission-qt.desktop file which the slackbuilds.org script fails to do.
