wine-staging (Wine Staging is the testing area of winehq.org)

## NSA APPROVED THIS HACK FROM SLACKBUILDS.ORG ##

## IT'S A TRAP ##
## THIS PULLS  ##
##  FROM GIT   ##

Git Clones from Master Branch, dont like this?  Edit the .SlackBuilds file.

This will compile 32 bit, 64 bit, or both (if you so choose)!

## OPTIONS ##

With no options this SlackBuild will compile ONLY 32 bit wine-staging.

## To build a package for both 64 bit and 32 bit:

WIN64=yes ./wine-staging-patched.SlackBuild

## To disable win32 support, use:

NOWIN32=yes ./wine-staging-patched.SlackBuild

## Or, combine them both for only 64 bit:

WIN64=yes NOWIN32=yes ./wine-staging-patched.SlackBuild

## To disable OpenGL support:

OPENGL=no ./wine-staging-patched.SlackBuild

It  contains  bug fixes and features (or may introduce more bugs. Who
knows? Only the NAS and Santa Claus), which have not been  integrated
into the development branch yet.  The  idea  of  Wine  Staging  is to
provide  experimental  features  faster  to  end  users  and  to give
developers  the  possibility  to  discuss  and  improve their patches
before they are integrated into the main branch.

While  this  is  list  as a separate package, this WILL overwrite your
normal Wine binaries! Please keep this in mind.

See README.SLACKWARE for a giant list of dependencies.

                     ## DANGER DANGER DANGER ##
## WIN64 requires multilibs!!!  grab my multilibs SlackBuild first! ##

How do I use wine in 32 or 64bit?

WINEARCH=win32
WINEARCH=win64

Realworld Example:

WINEARCH=win64 WINEPREFIX=/home/kamii/Games/WoW64 wine /home/kamii/Games/WoW64/drive_c/Program\ Files/World\ of\ Warcraft/Wow-64.exe
