wine-staging (Wine Staging is the testing area of winehq.org)

It  contains  bug fixes and features, which have not been  integrated
into the development branch yet.  The  idea  of  Wine  Staging  is to
provide  experimental  features  faster  to  end  users  and  to give
developers  the  possibility  to  discuss  and  improve their patches
before they are integrated into the main branch.

This  is  a  current  development  branch  of Wine appended with full
patches of Staging area.

NOTE:  At  the moment, it only compiles a 32-bit version of Wine, this
may change in the future with  the ability to compile both 64-bit  and
32-bit version of Wine.  You'll  need  a  multilib  system in order to
compile this.

While  this  is  list  as a separate package, this WILL overwrite your
normal Wine binaries! Please keep this in mind.

Compile  options/optional  dependences  (keep in mind, you need 32-bit
libs of each):

See README.SLACKWARE for a giant list of dependencies.
