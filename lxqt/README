This is a complete lxqt set of SlackBuilds.

As always my build scripts will automatically download the source code and verify them with an md5sum or sha1sum.

## DEPENDENCIES ##
## Dependencies found on http://slackbuilds.org/
QT5
libconf

## README ICONS ##

All icons will probably not show up by default, in order to get icons to display in pcmanfm-qt please install the faba-icon-theme and optionally the moko-icon-theme (which depends on faba).  Since these can be found on slackbuilds.org I do not feel the need to make my own slackbuild for these at this time.  I may in the future incorporate these as extras in the lxqt build.

## Changes since 0.9.0
liblxqt-mount is no longer supported and has been taken over by KF5 Solid
instead.  (If upgrading please removepkg liblxqt-mount-0.9.0-x86_64-1_KaMii).

I now offer all KDE dependencies which you can compile!  No more binaries!
