This is a complete lxqt set of SlackBuilds.

As always my build scripts will automatically download the source code and verify them with an md5sum or sha1sum.

This does not pull from git, so it should be as stable as verion 0.9.0 is.

#########  DISCLAIMER  #########
There is a bug with QT5 verion 5.4.0!
This bug is suppose to disapper with 5.4.1 but it has not been released yet!

## DEPENDENCIES ##
This requires QT5
KWindowSystem
KGuiAddons
