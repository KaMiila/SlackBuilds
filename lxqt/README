This is a complete lxqt set of SlackBuilds.

As always my build scripts will automatically download the source code and verify them with an md5sum or sha1sum.

This does not pull from git, so it should be as stable as verion 0.9.0 is.

## DEPENDENCIES ##
## Dependencies found on http://slackbuilds.org/
QT5
libconf
## Dependencies found from alienBOB http://alien.slackbook.org/slackware/ktown/
KWindowSystem
KGuiAddons
PolKitQt5
Solid (found in frameworks)

## README ICONS ##

All icons will probably not show up by default, in order to get icons to display in pcmanfm-qt please install the faba-icon-theme and optionally the moko-icon-theme (which depends on faba).  Since these can be found on slackbuilds.org I do not feel the need to make my own slackbuild for these at this time.  I may in the future incorporate these as extras in the lxqt build.

## IMPORTANT READ FOR DUAL MONITORS ##

If you have dual monitors (mulitihead) there are patches in pcmanfm-qt that will provide a fix for this.  It is not turned on by default because the patches are rather ugly hacks and most people probably do not want them implemented.  To enable the patches to apply, edit the pcmanfm-qt.Slackbuild file and change line 32 from NO to YES.

## Changes since 0.9.0
liblxqt-mount is no longer supported and has been taken over by
yet-another-KDE dependency.  Use KF5 Solid instead.  (Personal note:  The only
reason I want to use lxqt is to walk away from KDE while still using a qt DE,
forcing MOAR KDE shit fucking dependencies annoys the fuck out of me because
in-order to compile this you either need to first compile KDE, or grab
someone's binaries.  This project is turning into lazyness by the devs.  I may
stop using LXQT if they keep forcing KDE down my throat).
