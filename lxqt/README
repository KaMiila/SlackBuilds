This is a complete lxqt set of SlackBuilds.

As always my build scripts will automatically download the source code and verify them with an md5sum or sha1sum.

This does not pull from git, so it should be as stable as verion 0.9.0 is.

## IMPORTANT READ FOR DUAL MONITORS ##

If you have dual monitors (mulitihead) there are patches in pcmanfm-qt that will provide a fix for this.  It is not turned on by default because the patches are rather ugly hacks and most people probably do not want them implemented.  To enable the patches to apply, edit the pcmanfm-qt.Slackbuild file and change line 32 from NO to YES.
