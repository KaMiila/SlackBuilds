The above warning does not come from me, it comes from the developers.  Please heed their warnings, and be safe, for the NSA is always watching you.

libtcd is a required dependency for XTide.  It provides a software API for reading and writing Tide Constituent Database (TCD) files.

This SlackBuild will autodownload the source and check it against a md5sum hash which I provide.  If you do not trust my md5sum, then dont use this script.  The developer(s) of XTide do not provide any hash's.
